## üéØ Study Approach

### 1. Problem Understanding (10 minutes)
- Read requirements carefully
- Ask clarifying questions
- Identify functional vs non-functional requirements

### 2. Capacity Estimation (10 minutes)
- Calculate traffic estimates
- Estimate storage requirements
- Determine bandwidth needs
- Plan for peak loads

### 3. System Design (20 minutes)
- Start with high-level architecture
- Identify major components
- Design database schema
- Plan API endpoints

### 4. Deep Dive (15 minutes)
- Focus on critical components
- Discuss algorithms and data structures
- Address scalability concerns
- Consider failure scenarios

### 5. Scale & Optimize (5 minutes)
- Identify bottlenecks
- Propose scaling solutions
- Discuss monitoring and metrics
- Consider cost optimizations

## üîç Common Patterns

### Scaling Patterns
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers
- **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrade server capacity
- **Database Sharding**: Partition data across databases
- **Caching**: Multiple levels of caching
- **CDN**: Global content distribution

### Reliability Patterns
- **Replication**: Data redundancy
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Bulkhead**: Isolate critical resources
- **Retry with Backoff**: Handle transient failures
- **Health Checks**: Monitor system health

### Performance Patterns
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations
- **Batch Processing**: Group operations for efficiency
- **Compression**: Reduce data transfer
- **Indexing**: Optimize database queries

## üéØ Interview Tips

### Do's
- ‚úÖ Start with clarifying questions
- ‚úÖ Begin with simple design, then scale
- ‚úÖ Discuss trade-offs explicitly
- ‚úÖ Consider failure scenarios
- ‚úÖ Estimate capacity requirements
- ‚úÖ Use concrete numbers

### Don'ts
- ‚ùå Jump into details immediately
- ‚ùå Design for unlimited scale from start
- ‚ùå Ignore non-functional requirements
- ‚ùå Forget about monitoring and metrics
- ‚ùå Over-engineer the solution
- ‚ùå Ignore cost considerations

### Common Mistakes
1. **Not asking clarifying questions**
2. **Designing for perfect world (no failures)**
3. **Ignoring data consistency requirements**
4. **Not considering operational aspects**
5. **Over-complicating the initial design**
